3. **Expected Result**:

   - [Outcome 2]

### B. Unit & Integration Tests (If applicable)
[List specific suites or test files that need new coverage.]
- Add test case in `src/path/to/test.ts` to simulate [Behavior].
- Assert that [State] is correctly updated.
- Assert that [Error] is handled properly.

## 2. Documentation Updates
