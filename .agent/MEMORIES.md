# Project Memories & User Preferences

This file contains specific preferences and rules requested by the user (`roguectrl`) to be followed by all agents.

## Operational Rules

1.  **Prompt Handoffs**: When generating prompts or instructions for other agents/models (e.g., Claude Code), **ALWAYS create a physical Markdown (`.md`) file** in the workspace. Do not just display the content in the chat/preview. The user needs the raw file.

    *   *Context*: "Please add that to memories that: prompt generation requests should create actual markdown files and not whatever tool/shortcut you used before that generates just the preview"
