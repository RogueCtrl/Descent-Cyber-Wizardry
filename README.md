### Key Systems
- **Engine.js**: Core game loop and initialization
- **GameState.js**: State management and persistence
- **EventSystem.js**: Event handling and communication
- **UI.js**: Interface components and modal systems
- **Storage.js**: Data persistence and character management
- **Combat.js**: Turn-based battle system with party vs party mechanics
- **AudioManager.js**: Retro chiptune music synthesis and dynamic soundtrack
- **CombatInterface.js**: Combat UI and player action processing

## Contributing

Currently in early development with foundational systems being established. The project now features working combat encounters, dynamic chiptune audio, and a working "first doomed exploration" experience in the training grounds. While playable, many RPG systems still need implementation. Issues and pull requests welcome as development continues.

**Current State**: You can create characters, enter the training grounds, face the Ogre in glorious unarmed combat, and experience either victory or a dramatic party wipe with appropriate musical accompaniment. It's rough around the edges but captures the authentic Wizardry feel of sending hapless adventurers to their doom!
